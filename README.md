# process-oriented-cloud-evaluation
The multi-sensors A-train observations allow to make the correlation between the different cloud variables at the instantaneous time scale, and at high resolution (CALIPSO-GOCCP and MODIS, PARASOL). This allows to see how different key cloud properties (cloud fraction, cloud vertical distribution provided from CALIPSO and cloud reflectance measured by MODIS and PARASOL which is a good surrogate of the cloud optical depth) vary one as a function of the other and build pictures of cloud processes well suited for the evaluation of clouds in climate models. The COSP simulator allows to provide a description of the clouds simulated by the models that is consistent with these satellite observations and to build the same pictures from the models outputs and the simulator tools. The use of instantaneous joint observations facilitates the link between observations and parameterization in the models.

Preprocessing 
----------

The information of Latitude, Longitude and Land Ocean Mask should be given from netcdf files describing the standard geographical attributes of the model's grid cells.

Input
---------
| Frequency | Variable | Variable labels | Unit | File Format |
|:----------|:-----------------------------|:-------------|:------|:------------|
| - | Latitude grid | lat    |  degrees  | nc
| - | Longitude grid | lon    |  degrees  | nc
| - | Land Ocean Mask | pourc_oce   |  flag  | nc




Output
--------
The diagnostic calculation code needs the file 'tetas_lmdz96' as input information. This information is needed because the reflectance from PARASOL is given as a function of 5 solar zenith angles (tetas). In each case the corresponding tetas at the given place and at the given time should be chosen. We consider approximately that tetas depends on the latitude and on the reference month. To calculate the dependence of tetas on the model latitude and month, we use the program https://github.com/dimitrakonsta/process-oriented-cloud-evaluation/blob/master/preprocessing/code_tetas/fortran/ess_gcm2pold.f that uses as input the file 'latitude_lmdz96' and generates the ASCII file 'tetas_lmdz96'. Both files are provided in the Sect. data. The file 'tetas_lmdz96' gives for each grid of the model and for each month, the corresponding tetas. The diagnostic code reads this information and extrapolates the corresponding reflectance from PARASOL.


Diagnostic calculation
-----------------------

The diagnostic requires an estimate of the PARASOL reflectance of the cloudy part of each grid cell, but the standard COSP output provides the total value of PARASOL reflectance (i.e. cloud free + cloudy part of the grid cell). For that reason a small addition is required to the standard COSP simulator output in the routine where variables are written to output files (see https://github.com/dimitrakonsta/process-oriented-cloud-evaluation/blob/master/preprocessing/code_cosp/fortran/add_cosp_Crefl.f). 
In case where this variable is not provided, the diagnostics can still be proceeded with the use of 'parasol_refl' instead, but only at instantaneous (8hrly) time scale, as described in the code provided (https://github.com/dimitrakonsta/process-oriented-cloud-evaluation/blob/master/code/matlab/ref_cf.m).
