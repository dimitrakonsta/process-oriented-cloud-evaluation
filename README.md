# process-oriented-cloud-evaluation
The multi-sensors A-train observations allow to make the correlation between the different cloud variables at the instantaneous time scale, and at high resolution (CALIPSO-GOCCP and MODIS, PARASOL). This allows to see how different key cloud properties (cloud fraction, cloud vertical distribution provided from CALIPSO and cloud reflectance measured by MODIS and PARASOL which is a good surrogate of the cloud optical depth) vary one as a function of the other and build pictures of cloud processes well suited for the evaluation of clouds in climate models. The COSP simulator allows to provide a description of the clouds simulated by the models that is consistent with these satellite observations and to build the same pictures from the models outputs and the simulator tools. The use of instantaneous joint observations facilitates the link between observations relationship and parameterization in the models.

Preprocessing 
----------
The diagnostic requirs an estimate of the PARASOL reflectance of the cloudy part of each grid cell, but the standard COSP output provide the total value of PARASOL reflectance (i.e. cloud free + cloudy part of the grid cell). For that reason a small addition is required to the standard COSP simulator output in the routine where variables are written to output files (see add_cosp_Crefl.f in the code repository)
